            &emsp;In this Documentary Berger talks about how the effects of technology, 
            specifically the camera, can have an effect on how we perceive things in real life. 
            In episode 1 Berger primarily uses art to convey this as he talked about how you could 
            easily change the entire meaing of the the paintings simply by zooming into specific places 
            on the painting. In addition, he talks about how if paintings are recorded you can add subtle elements
            such as music and dialogue that can also alter your perspective on how you view the art.<br>
            &emsp;In Episode 2, Berger focuses on how paintings and picture taking played a role in objectifying women as 
            in a lot of works of art many of them were presented nude. Berger explained that there is a difference between 
            being naked and nude as being naked means that people can see your for who you really are not just on a surface level.
            However, being nude is simply not wearing any cloths which is only surface level as you don't learn anything about the 
            individual being painted. Berger remarks that with the exception of a few paintings the majority of european oil paintings depict 
            women as objects to be judged and spectacted for the pleasures of men.<br>
            &emsp;In Episode 3, Berger wanted to discuss the meaning of the european oil paintings. Today they are viewed as collectibles, things to be bought and 
            displayed. However, looking into them more you can discover that these paintings were meant to portray wealth and status. They were painted to be valued and celebrated. 
            In addition, these paintings were different then religious or cultural works as they weren't celebrating anyone specific in real life but painted to be celebrated themselves. 
            Portraits, for example, depict many of the individuals dressed heavily in silk and sometimes being worshipped by their slaves. Berger is trying to depict how a lot of these paintings
            were painted in order to prove self worth and to show off their wealth to others. <br>
            &emsp;In Episode 4, Berger explains how art and paintings try to make people enviable. That is how they become glamourous as the more people who desire that same level of prestige
            will become more attached to the art as they desire that same sort of lifestyle to a certain degree. Romance, wealth, power, and more these are all things that are enviable and thus 
            desirable by spectators. Which in fact is why many companies tried to create "art" that made their products desirable. As it was the best way to get people to buy their products. However,
            it's not just companies, it's social movements, government propaganda, and revolution tactics. They all try to get the spectator invested in with some sort of desire in mind. <br>
            &emsp; Overall, this documentary still holds a lot of weight and value in today's society. In many way's new forms of art has been created but overall many of the things that Berger 
            talked about is still in effect today. Commercial advertisments, propoganda, and more are all still made with the goal of selling a product that you believe will make your life better.
            However, today it is on a much larger scale as there are many more tools that these organizations can use to market somethings to you as we are constantly using technology every single day.
