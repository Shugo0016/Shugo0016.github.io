                <h2>Personal Effects by Solmaz Sharif</h2>
                <p>
                    <br><span></span>You’re posing. You’re scared.<br>
                    A body falls<br>
                    a loosened head. You begin to appreciate<br>
                    the heft of your boot soles,<br>
                    how they propel you,<br>
                    <br></span>

                    how they can kick in<br>
                    a face–<br>
                    the collapse<br>
                    <br>

                    of a canopy bed<br>
                    in an aerial bombardment,<br>
                    mosquito netting doused<br>
                    <br>

                    in napalm–cheekbones fragile<br>
                    as moth wings beneath the heel.<br>
                    You tighten your laces<br>
                    <br>

                    until they hold together<br>
                    a capable man.<br>
                    Whatever rains,<br>
                    <br>

                    the weight of your feet<br>
                    swings you forward,<br>
                    goose-stepping pendulums<br>
                    <br>

                    a body less and less yours–<br>
                    a body, God knows,<br>
                    is not what makes you<br>
                    <br>

                    anyway. So the hands<br>
                    that said they never would<br>
                    begin finding<br>
                    <br>

                    grenade pins around their fingers,<br>
                    begin flipping through this album<br>
                    with soot under their nails<br>
