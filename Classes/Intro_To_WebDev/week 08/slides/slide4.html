            <p> The last point needed to be addressed about this whole ordeal, is how much video games have evolved 
                over the past two decades. Counter-Strike got a sequel Counter Strike Global offensive which takes the 
                same gameplay loop from the original and expands upon it. However, the gaming industry doesn't just have a  
                few first person shooter games military inspired games anymore. It is arguably the most popular gaming genre 
                today with Call of Duty Modern Warfare selling 30 million copies over its 3 year lifespan. The reason these large 
                amount of sales can be concerning is because there was blatant historical innaccuracies in the game.
